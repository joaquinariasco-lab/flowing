# Flowing
### Observability & Tracing for Multi-Agent AI Workflows
Flowing provides tools to trace, log, and visualize how multiple AI agents interact and execute workflows, helping developers debug, understand, and improve agent coordination.

Rather than focusing on orchestration or being a universal interoperability layer, Flowing focuses on structured execution visibility so you can answer questions like:
- What steps did each agent take?
- When did tool calls happen and why?
- Where did context pass between agents?
- What caused a workflow to succeed or fail?
This visibility is essential for troubleshooting, performance optimization, cost control, and trust in multi-agent systems.

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters
Multi-agent systems are complex:
- Agents plan, reason, call tools, and coordinate asynchronously.
- Silent errors and emergent behavior are common.
- Traditional logs and simple prints don’t provide enough insight.
Flowing captures rich execution data structured logs, spans, traces, and interaction graphs to help you see what’s happening and why.

---

## ⚡What you can do with it
With Flowing’s current MVP you can:
- Run multiple independent agents and record execution traces
- Capture structured events for agent actions and tool invocations
- Reconstruct cross-agent workflows
- Generate interactive trace visualizations
- Improve debugging and reproducibility of complex runs

## 🚀 30-Second Quick Start

### Mac / Linux:
Open the terminal and paste:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joaquinariasco-lab/Flowing.git && cd Flowing && chmod +x install.sh run.sh && ./install.sh
```

Result:

### Window:
#### With git already installed:
Open PowerShell and paste:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joaquinariasco-lab/Flowing.git; cd Flowing; ./install.ps1
```
#### Without git already installed:
##### 1- Download the repository ZIP: "https://github.com/joaquinariasco-lab/Flowing/archive/refs/heads/main.zip"
##### 2- Extract it to a folder, e.g., C:\Users\YourName\Flowing
##### 3- Open PowerShell in the main folder (Shift + Right Click → “Open PowerShell window here”)
##### 4- Allow running scripts (only needed the first time):
```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
##### 5- Unblock the files:
```bash
Unblock-File .\install.ps1
```
```bash
Unblock-File .\run.ps1
```
##### 6- Execute the demo:
```bash
./install.ps1
```

Here’s a quick demonstration of the agents interacting:

## 📋 Demo Steps

This flowchart shows the steps when running the demo:

```mermaid

    User -->|Open Terminal| Terminal
    Terminal -->|Run install.ps1 / run.sh| VirtualEnv
    VirtualEnv --> AgentA
    VirtualEnv --> AgentX
    AgentA -->|Send Test Message| AgentX
    AgentX -->|Print Message & Execute Task| Terminal
```

## 🔄 Agent Interaction Example

```mermaid

    participant A as AgentA
    participant X as AgentX

    A->>X: {"message": "Hello from AgentA"}
    X-->>A: {"status": "ok"}
    A->>X: {"description": "Test task", "price": 10}
    X-->>A: {"balance": 10}
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

This diagram shows how AgentA and AgentX communicate:
