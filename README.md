# Flowing: Reliability & Execution Enforcement Layer for AI Systems
### Enforce correctness. Prevent invalid outputs. Make AI systems predictable.
Flowing is not a logging tool.

It is a runtime layer that sits between your AI system and execution, ensuring that outputs, tool usage, and workflows follow strict, verifiable rules.

---

## ⚡ 30-Second Quick Start
### Clone and run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joaquinariasco-lab/Flowing.git
cd Flowing
python3 -m venv flowing-env
source flowing-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python demo.py
```

---

## 🎯 Why this matters
Modern AI systems fail in ways that are hard to detect:
- LLMs return structured outputs that look valid but are wrong
- Agents ignore instructions and use incorrect tools
- Systems behave non-deterministically across runs
- Errors are often silent, hidden behind plausible outputs

Traditional approaches (logs, retries, prompting) do not solve this.

There is no enforcement layer between what should happen and what actually happens.

---

## ⚡The Problem
AI systems today are:
- Probabilistic → outputs are not guaranteed
- Uncontrolled → execution can deviate from instructions
- Opaque → failures are hard to trace and reproduce

This leads to:
- Broken workflows
- Incorrect results
- Loss of trust
  
---

## ✅ What Flowing does
Flowing introduces a control layer that:

- Validates structured outputs against strict schemas
- Enforces execution rules for agents and tools
- Detects inconsistencies and invalid states
- Prevents faulty outputs from propagating
- Provides full traceability of decisions and actions

---

## ⚡ Core Capabilities
With Flowing you can:
- Enforce structured output correctness (schema + rules)
- Control tool execution (prevent misuse or deviation)
- Intercept and validate agent actions in real time
- Automatically retry or block invalid outputs
- Capture execution traces for debugging and analysis

---

## 🔬 Example (conceptual)
Without Flowing:

LLM → returns valid-looking JSON → system accepts → hidden error propagates

With Flowing:

LLM → returns invalid output → Flowing detects violation → retries or blocks → only valid output passes

---

## 🧩 Repo Contents
- Validation engine (schema + rule enforcement)
- Execution control layer for agent workflows
- Retry and correction mechanisms
- Structured trace and logging system
- Demo scripts reproducing real failure scenarios

---

## 🚧 Current Status
Flowing is early but functional:

✔ Output validation and enforcement

✔ Execution interception layer

✔ Retry/correction loop

✔ Structured trace capture

❌ Full cross-framework integrations

❌ Production-ready runtime

❌ Standardized protocol layer

---

## 📈 Roadmap
Next steps focus on expanding from tool → infrastructure:
- Universal middleware for AI systems
- Standardized enforcement schemas
- Policy-based execution control
- Security and permission enforcement
- Distributed runtime layer
- Observability + enforcement unified system

--- 

## 🔥 Positioning

Flowing is not:
- a logging tool
- a tracing tool
- a debugging utility

Flowing is:
