"""
A minimal interoperability simulation between two ExampleAgent instances.
This script imports example_agent.py, creates two agents, and has them
send messages to each other, printing the messages to the console.

# Create two test agents
agent1 = ExampleAgent("Agent1")
agent2 = ExampleAgent("Agent2")

# Simulate sending messages between the agents

# Agent2 sends a reply to Agent1
agent2.send_message(agent1, "Hi Agent1! Agent2 here, nice to talk with you.")

# Additional exchange for demonstration
